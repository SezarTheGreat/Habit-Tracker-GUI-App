<h1 align="center" id="title">Habit-Tracker-GUI-App</h1>

<p id="description">A Habit Tracker App that was made by using Pixela API and python and its packages that is easy to use and provides a pixel tracking graph. It also has the protoype file for the pixela api testing when I was learning about api puts and deletes.Please check the config.py file for token and username as the token and username are used by me for testing and graph making purposes. Try to make your own usernames and token non hardcoded as it may be beneficial or at the very least make your own and hardcode them for your own usages.</p>
